 Go implementation of the Dominic Hotel mnemonic memory system 
 found in the book "Mind Performance Hacks". This is a system to help you
 remember up to 10,000 things.

 In order to remember long numbers a mnemonic system is needed. The following
 mnemonic associating is the building base.
 0=O, 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, 4=D, 5=E, 6=S, 7=G, 8=H, 9=N
 
 Next you need to create a memoryMap of names and actions to represent a 2
 digit number. For instance:
 AE => Albert Einstein: Writing on the chalkboard
 would represent number 15
 HO => Santa Claus: Laughing "HO HO HO"
 would represent number 80

 If you want to represent the number 1580 you would take the person from
 the first number and action from the second number, yielding: Albert Einstein
 laughing "HO HO HO"

 Yes, this means you need to come up with 100 name/action combinations.

 This program helps you see your 10,000 combinations
 The dominic.txt file is of the format Mnemonic:Name:Action, where a colon is the 
 separator and shouldn't be in the name or action.
